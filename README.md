# 3D Sandbox
A program to demonstrate raycasting by creating a 3D environment where the user can play around by moving and constructing objects from vertices. 
It was made about 2 years ago, when I was in high school, for the AP Computer Science final project. I reuploaded to GitHub in case anyone wants to see how it works and learn from it. It can only be run from cmu Academy online as it uses functions not available from the CMU-graphics package.
At some point, I may port to Pygame and refactor some code, since it performs poorly and could be simplified.
